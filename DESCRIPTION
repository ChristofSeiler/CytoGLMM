Description: The CytoGLMM R package implements two multiple regression 
  strategies: A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and a bootstrapped 
  generalized linear model (GLM). Most current data analysis tools compare 
  expressions across many computationally discovered cell types. CytoGLMM 
  focuses on just one cell type. Our narrower field of application allows us to 
  define a more specific statistical model with easier to control statistical 
  guarantees. As a result, CytoGLMM finds differential proteins in flow and 
  mass cytometry data while reducing biases arising from marker correlations 
  and safeguarding against false discoveries induced by patient heterogeneity.
